### 👋 Hello world!

#### My name is Brad and I am a web developer, teacher and coach in Chicago, IL. I am passionate about about using technology to create a more just, free and equal world. With over a decade of experience working in mathematics and computer science education, I understand the importance of a results-driven process combined with relationship building, empathy and understanding. I have taught myself, and my students, how to create beautiful, complex and responsive websites and mobile apps. When I am not teaching or coding, I can usually be found traveling to my next outdoor adventure, engaging in some form of exercise, or spending time with my family and friends, especially if they want to watch a Cleveland sports game.
